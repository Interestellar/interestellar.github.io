Ah, so this is what it feels like to officially submit my first blog post. It’s truly gratifying to be quite honest. I never really thought the day would come where I would actually create a blog, I mean, I’ve had plenty of people suggest I start one but I kind of just chuckled at the idea.

It wasn’t until I was asked by my Greek and Roman humanities professor to take a moment and think of what my ideal world would consist of. At this point in time, my mind began to race with a million thoughts and I immediately answered:

I want to live in a world filled with numerous stouts, innovative businesses, unlimited art supplies, loads of wild cuddles from Liam, and books that come bundled with dark chocolate. Okay. And with ice cream. And maybe some coffee or tea.

But that’s not all… I’ve always had a deep passion for helping others, hence my reason for pursuing a masters in rehabilitation counseling. So I thought to myself… why not use what I know and blog about it so I can assist others in bettering their lives, homes, etc.? People obviously suggested I start a blog for a reason.

So here I am today taking my first step towards helping broaden the horizons for those searching for answers. I, of course, wouldn’t expect you to take advice from a stranger so here is some insightful information about myself to get us acquainted…

+ 26-year-old mother to the silliest deep blue eyed one-year-old boy named Liam.
+ Full-time psychology major at the University of Central Florida.
+ Driven by schedules.
+ Enjoy traveling so I can experience different cultures and land.
+ Mind is full of wonders so you can always bet that I am delving into a book for more wisdom.

When I’m not researching information you can find me:

Elbows deep in some kind of art project.
- Answering the question “why” for the billionth time.
- Pestering my boyfriend Michael to admire our new “love fern”.
- Analyzing our cat Xena who dreamily stares at Michael.
- Snapping photos of our farm animals… yes, you read that right, I live on a farm in Central Florida. Here are a couple photos of my animals:
