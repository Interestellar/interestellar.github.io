I want to live in a world filled with numerous stouts, innovative businesses, unlimited art supplies, loads of wild cuddles from Liam, and books that come bundled with dark chocolate. Okay. And with ice cream. And maybe some coffee or tea.

I’m a mother to the silliest deep blue eyed one-year-old boy named Liam, and a full-time psychology major at the University of Central Florida. I’m driven by schedules, enjoy traveling so I can experience different cultures and land, and have a deep passion for helping others.

My mind is full of wonders and you can always bet that I am delving into a book for more wisdom.
When I’m not researching information, you can find me elbows deep in some kind of art project, answering the question “why” for the billionth time, pestering my boyfriend Michael to admire our new “love fern”, analyzing our cat Xena who dreamily stares at Michael, and snapping photos of our farm animals… I mentioned I live on a farm in Central Florida, right?

It is my desire to one day be an inspiration to young mothers out there striving to get their degree and take care of their family. I also hope to provide entertaining and useful crafts, information, and advice for any age or gender so they can live a fulfilled life.
